Koda combines a complete music player and a complete video player in one app. Switch modes from Home and the feed, search, library, and player adapt with it.

It works without an official YouTube API key, and an account is optional. Search, playback, downloads, local playlists, likes, subscriptions, and recommendations can all work on the device; signing in adds your YouTube feeds, library, history, comments, and other account features.

## Download

Download the latest APK from **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ivorisnoob/Koda/releases/latest)**. Koda requires Android 11 or newer.

| APK | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `arm64-v8a` | Almost every modern Android phone. Start here. |
| `armeabi-v7a` | Older 32-bit devices. |
| `universal` | A larger build containing both architectures. |

Android will ask for permission to install an app from outside the Play Store. After installation, Koda's updater can check GitHub Releases and select the correct APK automatically.

Official builds are published only on GitHub and in the [Telegram community](https://t.me/ivorisnoob_chat). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before installing a build from anywhere else.
